# Numpy_Notes
This is my “Cheat Sheet” of Numpy methods as I was going through the Beginners Tutorial. I am taking notes of what I learned and made a word document to follow through. This is mostly just for beginners like me who want take notes.



The topics I included were:

•	The Basics

•	Array Creation

•	Adding, Removing, and sorting elements

•	Reshaping an array

•	Matrix Multiplication 

•	Creating arrays from existing data

•	Indexing and slicing 

•	Basic array operations 

•	Useful array operations 

•	Creating matrices 

•	Random Generator 

•	Unique items and counts

•	Transposing a matrix

•	Reversing an array

•	Copy vs View

•	Reshaping and flattening multidimensional arrays

•	Saving and loading arrays

This is just for notes so not everything is covered with specific detail. I just went through the beginners tutorial from the Numpy Documentation.
